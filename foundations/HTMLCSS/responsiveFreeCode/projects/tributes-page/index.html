        <h2>The generic tale</h2>
        <blockquote cite="https://www.worldhistory.org//gilgamesh/#tag_definition_wrapper">
          According to Worldhistory, gilgamesh, according to the <em>Epic of gilgamesh</em> is the
          fourth king of uruk who had an immense fear of being worthless and by implication, feared
          death itself after losing his best friend who was sent to him by the Gods , initially as
          an adversary to humble him.
        </blockquote>

        <h2>Gilgamesh, as depicted in the <em>fate </em>series</h2>
        <p>
          In the fate series however, giglamesh is resurrected as a heroic spirit who was the
          strongest among his peer, as he had the strength of a ruler despite being an archer class.
          This fit his dimeanor perfectly as gilgamesh carried himself as a king should and would.
          In the fate series, he showed little care for the holy grail and by implication , sought
          pleasure in the new life given to him. This lead him to side with Kotomine kirei, a priest
          who was similarly poised in the battle, without any need for the grail. Kirei was
          different in the sense that he had no desires but that of the duties instilled upon him,
          that is, till Gilgamesh came along and showed him the beauty of joy.
        </p>
        <p>
          The two new friends continued to search for entertainment in the war, and ended up going
          on a stand-off with my favorite hero-character thus far, Kiritsugu, He had - what I would
          believe were -righteuous intentions for the grail. In the end, kiritsugu destroyed the
          grail with Kotomine and Gilgamesh inside of it. Hence, Gilgamesh gained material form, and
          became one of the first servants to have stayed after the war. Their story continues to
          fate/stay-night where the true nature of Gilgamesh is shown as he wished to destroy the
          world due to the plain nature of things. He had come to realise that the people of the
          world lead meaningless lives (tying back to his generic tale).
        </p>
        <p>
          In the end, Gilgamesh was reabsorbed by the grail and his plan was foiled, but oh my oh
          my, what a nice servant he was. He had the strongest weapon of all, nue. Which could
          destroy any attack casted to it, and on top of that, he also had a noble phantasm that
          contained every noble phantasm's origin. A fitting toolkit for a king who had it all.

            In summary, I rushed this review of gilgamesh to put some text here, but I honestly love
            this character and would expand this later on with a proper review of the hero Gilgamesh
            For now, here is the generic article from
