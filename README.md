# workflow explained  
  
If you're contributing, make sure to do the following:  
1. ALWAYS pull before you start contributing  
2. Create a branch for your contributions  
3. Setup your local repository with that branch and work solely on it,  
 making sure to keep main branch updated in your local workspace  
4. If you want to add that feature, submit a pull request for comparison with main before merging   
5. If all's well, you can merge your changes after pulling to your local main then push to main.  
6. You can continue working on your branch afterwards.  
  
Hints:  
  
1. To branch main:  
 ```Shell  
$git checkout main   $git branch {yourBranchName}  
```  
2. To move from branch to branch:  
```Shell  
$git checkout {branchName}  
```  
3. To "Publish" or "Push" your branch to the repository from local:  
```Shell  
$git push -u origin {yourBranchName}  
```
