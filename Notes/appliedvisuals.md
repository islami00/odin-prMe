#Visual balance
  
Text is often a large part of web content. CSS has several options for how to align it with the text-align property.

text-align: justify; causes all lines of text except the last line to meet the left and right edges of the line box.
  
```CSS
text-align: center;
``` 
centers the text
  
```CSS
text-align: center;
``` 
right-aligns the text
  
And 
```CSS
text-align: left; 
```
(the default) left-aligns the text.
